    As part of our industrial attachment, our assigned project revolves around
    the development of a credit scoring system aimed at assessing the
    eligibility of Upay users for loans. This system leverages machine learning
    techniques to use multiple data files, including transaction history and
    customer information, to predict the likelihood of a user receiving a loan.
    The ultimate goal of this project is to deliver an efficient and precise
    credit scoring system that facilitates loan disbursement decision-making.
    Additionally, it will offer decision makers some insights into their
    customer\â€™s loan eligibility and the potential loan amount they could
    receive. We are also developing a user interface where users can upload data
    files to receive loan decisions, loan probability assessments, and suggested
    loan amounts for eligible applicants.
